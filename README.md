# BikeSales
This project involves the analysis of bike sales data through comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Excel. The dataset was meticulously cleaned to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy. The EDA process uncovered key insights into bike purchasing behaviors based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. An interactive dashboard was created, featuring pivot tables and charts to dynamically visualize data trends. Key features include interactive slicers for real-time data filtering, column and line charts to highlight trends, and detailed pivot tables summarizing data by gender, income, age bracket, and commuting habits. The dashboard provides an intuitive and powerful tool for exploring and understanding bike sales data.
